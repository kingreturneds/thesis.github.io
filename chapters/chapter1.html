    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Security system is a means or method by which something is served through a
         system of interworking components and devices. Security systems works on the same 
         basic principle of securing entry points, like doors and windows, as well as interior 
         space containing valuables (Retrieved from: www.safewise.com/home-security-faq/how-do-security-systems-work,
          Retrieved date: November 16, 2022). For instance, the home security system, its door locks. The door lock is 
          the fastener fitted to a door or drawer to keep it firmly closed (Retrieved from: www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/doorlock, Retrieved date: November 16, 2022). Door lock has its two types: the Traditional lock & Smart lock. Traditional locks are what people refer to 
          as typical locks; these locks need a physical key to open them. Smart locks are what people refer to as a
           lock that is controlled by a phone, or another device such as a fob. 
          These locks use either Wi-Fi or Bluetooth and sometimes a physical key or ID card to unlock a door. 
          (Retrieved from: www.keytek.co.uk/blog/smart-locks-vs-traditional-locks-2/, Retrieved date: October 5, 2021). 
          Smart locks commonly use RFID technology and keypad door lock.  RFID (radio frequency identification) is a form of 
          wireless communication that incorporates the use of electromagnetic or electrostatic coupling in the radio frequency
           portion of the electromagnetic spectrum to uniquely identify an object, animal or person (Retrieved from: 
            www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/RFID-radio-frequency-identification Retrieved Date: November 21, 2022).
             Keypad door lock, this type of lock system requires a numerical code to grant entry to a facility or property.
              The code is punched in by users via a numerical pad, similar to those on a basic calculator. If the correct code 
              is entered, the door lock or deadbolt should be released (Retrieved from: www.gvlock.com/blog/keypad-locks-101/,
               Retrieved date: November 16, 2022). In making the security tighter: researchers can combine those two, to Alarm 
               system and SMS alert & authentication. Alarm systems can provide early warning of unauthorized access to your 
               facilities by producing different kinds of sounds. (Retrieved from: www.protectivesecurity.govt.nz/physical-security
               /lifecycle/design/specific-security-measures/alarm-systems/, Retrieved date: November 22, 2022). SMS alert is a
                wireless communications solution to monitor alarms and control the remote equipment from anywhere, anytime
                 (Retrieved from: www.allegro.com.sg/sms-alert-system/, Retrieve Date: November 14, 2022) while SMS authentication
                also known as SMS-based two-factor authentication (2FA) and SMS one-time password (OTP)—allows users to verify
                their identities with a code that is sent to them via text message 
                (Retrieved from: www.okta.com/blog/2020/10/sms-authentication/, Retrieved date: October 26, 2020).
                 These can only be possible by the use of Arduino, an open-source platform used for building electronics projects.
                 Arduino consists of both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) 
                and a piece of software,
                 or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer,
                used to write and upload computer code to the physical board (Retrieved from: 
        learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/what-is-an-arduino/all Retrieved date: November 22, 2022).</p>
        <h2>Background of the Problem</h2>
        
        <p>Factors in monitoring security systems such as installing, arming, disarming, paying monthly fees, and dealing with false alarms may cause the consumers to wonder if home security systems are worth the inherent hassle. This is a good question to consider to determine the best way to protect the valuables of the consumer and their loved ones.</p>
        <p>According to Mince-Didier (2022), unlawful entry into a structure without permission is a crime. A home invasion is a type of burglary or, sometimes, a trespass. Although laws and details vary from state to state, in general, it involves breaking into someone else's residence in order to commit a crime inside.</P>
        <p>Budget Direct in the year (2022) stated that crime rates in 27 international cities showed that burglaries fell by 28% under lockdown conditions. Homeowners should not breathe easily, as the lockdown eases, the conditions for housebreaking also improve. </p>
        <p>Now looking at the global picture: Peru has the highest burglary rate in the world, with 2086 per 100 000 people per year. The world's lowest burglary rate is in Bangladesh: 1 per 100 000. Australia's burglary rate is 911 per 100 000—the third highest in the world. The US burglary rate is 527 per 100 000—number 15 out of 85 countries. Every 13 seconds a home burglary takes place, four burglaries a minute, 240 an hour, and nearly 6000 a day. FBI burglary rates of homes state that 1 in 3 homes without a security system will fall victim to a burglary as compared to 1 in 250 homes that do have a security system.</p>
        <p>In the Philippines, according to Ombay (2022), the number of crime incidents in the country recorded from January to August 2022 has gone down by 8%, compared to the data from the same period last year, the Philippine National Police (PNP) said. However, theft increased by 8.62% this year, as well as robbery by 0.49%: the crimes that can also fall into home invasion or burglary. </p>
        <p>Although a lot of robberies and break-ins do occur when people are not home, people shouldn’t assume that nothing will ever happen while they're and their family are at the house. The truth is that some people will rob their home even if there are people inside, and some people might even break into their home with the intent of harming their family. Even if those people have weapons in the house, people never know when they could be caught by surprise.</p>
        <p>That’s why the need to upgrade locks is rising. Stop waiting, too many people put off home security until after they’ve already been burgled. It is easy to think that burglary is something that happens to “other people,” but the truth is it could happen to any of the people. 
            Installing a security system in homes may help homeowners to be more prepared and lessen the chance of getting caught by surprise. With a burglar alarm system, homeowners can be notified with a loud alarm in the event that someone tries to sneak into their home. Surveillance cameras can also spot the person on the camera before anything happens. This will give time to the victim to figure out a plan for how to handle the situation instead of leaving them caught by surprise.</p>
        <p>As a result, in order to reach the milestone of safety and security, researchers devised the concept of designing a security system that only an authenticated person can enter by designing and implementing RFID and Keypad lock with Alert system and SMS alert & authentication using Arduino.</p>
        <p>It is possible to design various door locks, such as mechanical locks or electrical locks, to meet the fundamental requirement of security. These door locks are designed with one or more keys, but multiple locks are required to lock up a large area. Traditional locks typically weigh a lot and are weak, as they can be broken with a few simple tools. To solve the security issues associated with mechanical locks, electronic locks are preferable to those made of metal. Every device today uses digital technology. For instance, the automatic opening and closing of doors, the identification of digital devices using tokens, door lock systems that use digital technology, etc. These types of systems are employed to regulate the movement of doors.</p>
        <h2>Overview of the Current State of the Technology</h2>
        <p>According to Keymitt in the year (2022), designed to ensure privacy and secure access, nowadays people find a lock on almost everything from home’s front door to our smartphone. This goes to show how people, as a society, have come to value privacy and safety more and more over time.</p>
        <p>Despite what all of the people would like to believe, most common locks are highly vulnerable to picking an experienced burglar that could snap a deadbolt and stage a break in only a matter of seconds. Unfortunately, someone’s front door is not as secure as he thinks it will.</p>
        <p>The electronic/smart locks do eliminate the risk of someone sweeping the key under their doormat, picking their lock, or if this happens, the smart lock will be able to immediately alert the homeowners about it, no matter where in the country they are. </p>
        <p>Smart locks commonly use RFID technology. Most of the time everybody used it without even realizing it. For example, when they unlock their hotel room door by waving their key card, or have a microchip implanted in their pet, they are using RFID technology. According to TT Electronics (2020), the RFID technology across industries continues to evolve, rendering RFID elements across major world industries: Aerospace & Defence, Medical, and Industrial Internet of Things.</p>
        <p>Amsler (2021) stated that RFID dates back to the 1940s; however, it was used more frequently in the 1970s. For a long time, the high cost of the tags and readers prohibited widespread commercial use. As hardware costs have decreased, RFID adoption has also increased.</p>
      

        <p>Some common uses for RFID applications include:</p>
        <p>1.Pet and Livestock Tracking</p>
        <p>2.Inventory Management</p>
        <p>3.Asset Tracking and Equipment Tracking</p>
        <p>4.Inventory Control</p>
        <p>4.Inventory Control</p>
        <p>6.Vehicle Tracking</p>
        <p>7.Customer Service and Loss Control</p>
        <p>8.Improve Visibility and Distribution in the Supply Chain </p>
        <p>9.Access Control in Security Situations</p>
        <p>10.Shipping</p>
        <p>11.Health Care</p>
        <p>12.Manufacturing</p>
        <p>13.Retail Sales</p>
        <p>14.Tap-and-Go Credit Card Payments</p>
        <p>Except for RFID technology, smart locks also commonly use keypad locks. According to Strauss, 2019 Keypad locks has the benefits of:</p>
        <p>1.   Convenience of a Keyless System. The biggest advantage is convenience. It eliminates the necessity of keys. There’s no need to carry them around, keep track of copies and spares, or change locks when a key is stolen or misplaced. Children, guests and service providers can be given their own code or a temporary code, rather than a key.</p>
        <p>2.   Higher Security. Keypad locks have a different hardware design than other types of locks. They don’t have cylinder mechanisms, so they essentially cannot be picked or bumped like conventional locks. This keeps the building more secure. Instead of risking losing keys and having to rekey or change out the lock. With a keypad system, it’s easy to change the security pin code whenever necessary.</p>
        <p>3.   Enhanced Durability. Traditional keys and locks wear down over time; it becomes more difficult to get it to turn and function properly. Keypads are much more durable than conventional locks. A high-quality lock and keypad device should last longer with standard hardware.</p>
        <p>4.   Easy Installation. Many property owners think that if they want to install a keypad lock, they’ll have to make major adjustments to the door or frames. That’s not true. In most cases, keypad locks can be easily installed on standard doors, just like any standard lock. Mechanical and battery-powered keypad locks are available which don’t require connection to a power source.</p>
        <p>5.   Integration with Access Control Systems. Keypad systems can be used as part of an access control system. This allows companies to restrict entry permission, even when using the correct code, during certain hours of the day or night. Businesses can also place a keypad entry system within the interior of a building. This restricts access to certain parts of the facility. It’s handy for business owners who want to limit employee access to certain parts of an office complex during certain times of the day.</p>
       
       
        <p>In making the security tighter: the researchers decided to combine those two-way identification, to Alarm system and SMS alert & authentication. And according to more in-depth analysis of Kisi (2022), the three (3) main types of alarm we all may be looking for are:</p>
        <p>1.   Fire Alarm Systems. Mostly a legal or insurance requirement. Smoke detectors or carbon monoxide detectors trigger the alarm to notify everything in the space and turn on the sprinklers. </p>    
        <p>2.   Burglary Alarm Systems. Detects an unwanted burglar comes to visit your office after hours or on weekends, you probably want a burglary system set up. Those systems typically operate on a simple principle: They get activated with a code or card and from then on every time someone comes through the door and does not deactivate the alarm in time, they set off a large-scale alarm.</p>
        <p>3.   Intrusion Detection System. The most advanced entry alarm system is the intrusion detection system. They are usually paired with a SOC (Security Operations Control room) where a security operator sits and controls any events happening around the doors.</p>
        <p>While according to Clickatell in the year (2022) these are the 4 potent ways people can use SMS alert for security in our current state:</p>
        <p>1.   App user notification for security problems with their app. If your app is hacked and bugs out or experiences user-wide technical problems (it won't log in, or it bounces the user back to the home screen), and people's private information starts appearing online- you're in trouble. Your best course of action is to send out a mobile SMS that alerts everyone to the new security threat and controls the mass-deletion of your app.</p>
        <p>2.   Secure in-app currency delivery is growing in popularity. For a multi-layered mobile SMS experience, that guarantees your users' currency delivery instantly after payment, on a secure network- mobile SMS is the answer.</p>
        <p>3.   Even more security is available for mobile SMS users that have an 'exclusive area' marketing plan. Once your app user reaches a certain level in-game, or in-app, they unlock a special SMS that is sent to them with a previously hidden URL address, where they can interact with other 'elite' members.</p>
        <p>4.Use mobile SMS to pay for in-app items directly. Get your users to pay via premium SMS, so that money is deducted off their prepaid airtime, or added to their phone bill at the end of the month. For cheap in-app purchases it's highly secure because no details need to be entered or shared.</p>
        <p> As for SMS authentication it has its pros listed below according to Shyamsundar (2020):</p>
        <p>1.More secure than passwords alone. Passwords are inherently weak because users tend to forget them, recycle them across various accounts, or have them stolen due to poor storage practices (e.g., writing them on a sticky note). SMS authentication helps to minimize our reliance on passwords, and makes it more difficult for bad actors to steal logins and hack accounts.</p>

        <p>2.Convenience. One of the reasons users recycle passwords is because of the sheer volume of online accounts they create and manage: our research shows that people have to remember 10 passwords every day. SMS authentication removes this hassle as it sends unique codes directly to the user, which they can then easily input on a website or app to verify their identities.</p>
        <p>3.Better than no 2FA. Proving an identity with more than one piece of information is always going to be more secure than proving it with a single factor. SMS authentication, therefore, is a safer alternative.</p>

            <p>The studies that the researchers have cited will only prove that the security system technology is constantly evolving, and new technologies are constantly being innovated to improve the security of home and business security systems alike. From constantly improving camera processors to smarter, more capable alarm sensors, and a whole host of new alerts and smart features that make our life and use our systems easier, these new features and technologies are making security more effective than ever before. </p>
            <p>This paper provides knowledge on RFID, SMS, and Keypad door lock technology. Here the researchers use the RFID card as a way to trigger the SMS authentication. Once the RFID reader scans the RFID card and it is not authenticated: this will result into SMS alert sending a notification to the owner stating that there is someone who is trying to force their way in, and after that it will display the word "INVALID" on the LCD, and the Alarm system and LED lights will be activated for warning while the door remains closed. </p>
            <p>If the RFID is authenticated, the word "VALID" will be displayed on the LCD and will proceed on generating a unique code or One Time Passcode (OTP), and send it to the registered mobile number in the system. If the user failed to input the OTP correctly for at least three (3) times, SMS alert will send a notification to the owner stating that there is someone who is trying to force their way in, and after that the Alarm system and LED lights will be activated.</p>
            <p>This will have a short delay to reset and use the whole system again. But if the passcode is correct: it will send a SMS notification to the owner, and it will display the word "OPEN" on the LCD, and the door will open. This will automatically close after ten (10) seconds, but the researchers leave the users with choice that’s why the system has a button switch where they can stop the automatically closing of the door.</p>
            <p>This device will make the security system notify the property owner if their property was subjected to home invasion/ burglary, this door lock can be installed in any kind of doors. This device has the very purpose of providing a robust security system with automatic notification and OTP. It is a developed safety security and impermeable to buffle this security system. Security is maintained with the sequential operation of the RFID card and OTP input, and with the missing one, access is denied.</p>
            <h2>Project Rationale</h2>
            <p>House Owner. Anticipated in this study: homeowners will have more efficient or safer security in their home. It makes the owner more relaxed when they are out of home by having reminders and awareness of the state of their home’s door using SMS security with an alert system, in addition to a two-way identification lock: RFID card and passcode input.</p>
            <p>Business Owner (Small or Medium). People all know that entrepreneurs will need some efficient security because they do business. Business exists alongside money. Due to that, they can attract intruders or should the researchers say, robbers. So, they will surely benefit from tight security like what the researchers are aiming to develop.</p>
            <p>Researchers. Researchers will be improving their skills in finding solutions to complex problems, and learning how to build a prototype of their project and their skill in programming.</p>
            <p>Future Researchers. This study is significant to future researchers as they will have more basis and comparison for their future work.</p>
            <p>Country. If most of the countrymen purchase and install this on their property as their security system or as their door lock, somehow the researchers can make the country's burglary rate go down. If the property owners have efficient security, intruders can't force their way in their door, so it goes.</p>
            <p>Maintaining good security on someone’s property or home is very important. Their home is their sanctuary. If they happen to own a business, their company location functions as a sanctuary as well. Their property, belongings, memories and investments are located within these structures. Most importantly, it’s a safe place for them, their family, their employees and their pets. While insurance offers one type of protection, it simply isn’t enough.<br>
                This study will allow them to monitor what is happening in their home even if they're not there personally. The presence of a home or business security system inevitably brings peace of mind to the lives of property owners and their families. It’s hard to put a price on peace of mind, and the reduction of stress and increase in well-being makes the investment in a security system more than worth it.</p>
