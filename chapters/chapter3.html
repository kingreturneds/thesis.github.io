    <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
    <h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This chapter presents the results and analysis of the design and implementation of a 
        reference frequency identification (RFID), keypad lock, and short message service 
        (SMS) security system. The system was developed using an Arduino-based platform with an alert system.</p>
    <p>In this chapter, the experimental setup and methodology used to collect data for the project will be described, followed by the presentation and analysis of the data collected. The performance of the RFID, keypad lock, and SMS security system will also be evaluated and compared to other similar systems.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, this chapter will provide an overview of the software used in the project, including any programming languages or libraries utilized, and discuss any challenges or limitations encountered during the development of the software.</p>
    <p>Overall, the results and analysis presented in this chapter will demonstrate the effectiveness of the RFID, keypad lock, and SMS security system and provide insights into its performance and limitationse</p>
    <h3>Experimental</h3>
    <p>The approach and setting utilized to collect data for the study are described in the experimental section. A thorough explanation of the hardware, software, and testing methods utilized in the project are provided in this section.</p>
