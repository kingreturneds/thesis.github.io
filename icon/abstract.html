   <div class="ess"><p>This research aims to design and implement a reference frequenc
        y identification (RFID), keypad lock, and short message service (SMS) security system
         using an Arduino-based with alert system. The system is designed to provide a secure and 
         efficient means of access control for using RFID. The proposed system utilizes RFID technology 
         to authenticate users and keypad lock to enable access to the system. In addition, the system sends 
         SMS alerts to the registered phone numbers in case of unauthorized access attempt. The performance of the 
         system is evaluated through experimental testing of its 
        different components, including RFID scanning efficiency, 
      OTP generation, alarm triggering, LED indication, buzzer activation, 
      SMS delivery, and bypass testing. The proposed system provides an effective means 
      of securing various applications, including homes, offices, and laboratories.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="find"><h2>Findings</h2>
    <p>1.The RFID scanning efficiency of the system was found to be high.<br>
        <span> 1.1.</span>The RFID scanning process had a high success rate of accurately detecting and identifying registered RFID tags, indicating that the system's scanning efficiency was reliable and effective. <br>
        <span>1.2.</span>The scanning speed of the RFID system was tested and found to be fast and efficient, allowing for quick and easy access to the secured area. <br>
        2.The One time password (OTP) generation was found to be efficient, and the system was capable of generating a unique OTP for each access attempt. <br>
        <span>2.1.</span>The use of OTP enhances the security of the system by reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access. The unique OTP generated by the system ensure that only authorized personnel can gain access. <br>
        <span>2.2.</span>The efficient generation of OTP also improves the user experience by reducing wait times and delays in accessing secure areas. This can increase user satisfaction and adoption of the system. <br>
        3.The alarm triggering and LED indication system were found to be effective in alerting the user of an unauthorized access attempt. <br>
        4.The buzzer activation system was found to be effective in producing an audible alarm. <br>
        5.The SMS delivery system was found to be efficient in sending alerts to the registered phone numbers in case of an unauthorized access attempt. <br>
        <span>5.1.</span>The SMS delivery system was reliable, and alerts were received by the registered phone numbers in a timely manner, ensuring that any potential security breaches could be quickly identified and addressed.</p>

    <div class="finds"><P>Overall, the study showed that the proposed system is an effective means of securing various 
        applications, including homes, offices, and laboratories. The system achieved high accuracy and efficiency
         in authenticating users and detecting unauthorized access attempts. The proposed system provides a comprehensive 
         and efficient solution to the problem of unauthorized access attempts. The findings of this study contribute to
          the field of access control 
        and security systems, providing a valuable solution to the problem of unauthorized access.</P>

    <div class="findw"><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>The researchers decided to develop this kind of design project to show to others how can we improve our security on our properties and protect it while youâ€™re keeping track on what happening on your security. That we can have alert or notification while being away on your properties. Not everyone can use it because its bit costly compare to normal doorknob or other padlock. Many will be interested to this idea and design project because it will help to minimize and decrease the rate of burglary. Using this design project will help everyone relax and spent their time not thinking what could happen on their properties without there knowing.
        It is not only applicable in the Philippines but also around the world. A lot of people having a problem on burglary cases. It will help people who always not on their home all the time and properties that need a good security and alert system. So our group decided to have "Design and Implementation of Reference Frequency Identification (RFID), Keypad Lock, and Short Message Service (SMS) Security: an Arduino-Based with Alert System" as our design project.

    <div class="finde"><h2>Recommendations</h2><p>1.Increase security measures: Based on the results of the study, it may be recommended that the system's security measures be improved. For example, additional encryption or authentication protocols could be implemented to prevent unauthorized access.<br>
        2.Improve user interface: If the study found that users had difficulty using the system, it may be recommended that the user interface be improved. This could involve simplifying the interface, providing more user-friendly instructions, or improving the design of the hardware.<br>
        3.Expand functionality: If the study found that the system was effective but lacked certain features, it may be recommended that the system be expanded to include additional functionality. For example, additional sensors could be added to the system to provide more detailed information.<br>
        4.Conduct further testing: If the study was limited in scope or time, it may be recommended that further testing be conducted to validate the results. This could involve conducting additional experiments, testing the system in different environments, or soliciting feedback from a larger sample of users.<br>
        5.Implement the system in real-world scenarios: If the study found that the system was effective, it may be recommended that the system be implemented in real-world scenarios. This could involve collaborating with a company or organization to deploy the system and gather data on its effectiveness in a real-world context.</p>
